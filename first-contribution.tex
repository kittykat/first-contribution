% - Give the names in the same order as the appear in the paper.
% - Use the \inst{?} command only if the authors have different

\date%[GUADEC 2013] % (optional, should be abbreviation of conference name)
{GUADEC 2013}

% If you have a file called "university-logo-filename.xxx", where xxx

% Structuring a talk is a difficult task and the following structure
% may not be suitable. Here are some rules that apply for this
% solution: 

% - Exactly two or three sections (other than the summary).
% - At *most* three subsections per section.
% - Talk about 30s to 2min per frame. So there should be between about
%   15 and 30 frames, all told.

% - A conference audience is likely to know very little of what you
%   are going to talk about. So *simplify*!
% - In a 20min talk, getting the main ideas across is hard
%   enough. Leave out details, even if it means being less precise than
%   you think necessary.
% - If you omit details that are vital to the proof/implementation,
%   just say so once. Everybody will be happy with that.
